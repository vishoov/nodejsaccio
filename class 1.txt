    terminal - npm init -y

SERVER -> delegation of technical tasks
MAIN-> endpoint of the project meaning that when we deploy this, 
        this file is used to access all the project features


Q-> whats the use of package.json ->
it contains the technical specifications like version, name, authors, custom scripts, 
listing the packages of the project
Q-> difference between package-lock.json and package.json -> 
    pckage-lock contains the stable current versions of the packages that we have used in our projects
Q-> How can we write custom scripts for our projects                                 
        we can write custom scripts in scripts section of package.json
Custom Scripts-> helpful in case of production environment 

Tech Environments

1) development env -> API  -> building and testing 
        - monitor the working of api, debug, create tokens, error handling 
2) production environment -> Deployed  -> error free 
        - only functionality and the features are used



2) Setup the project
    package - express.js
                - routing, security, authentication, handling the data

    1) npm install express
    2) in index.js -> const express = require("express") -> imports express
    3) const app = express() -> intialised the express app
